Hi SalesApe Team,

IMPORTANT: When a lead books an appointment through your calendar link, please include these fields in your webhook payload:

{
  "CRM_ID": "lead-uuid-from-our-system",
  "SalesAPE_Status": "Booking Confirmed",
  "SalesAPE_Goal_Hit": true,
  "SalesAPE_Initial_Message_Sent": true,
  "SalesAPE_User_Engaged": true,
  "SalesAPE_Goal_Presented": true,
  "Booking_Date": "2025-11-25",
  "Booking_Time": "14:30",
  "Event_Type": "Photoshoot Booking",
  "Conversation_Summary": "Brief summary of conversation",

}

REQUIRED FIELDS FOR BOOKINGS:
- Booking_Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- Booking_Time (format: HH:MM in 24-hour time)

This will automatically update the lead status to "Booked" in our CRM and store the appointment details.
