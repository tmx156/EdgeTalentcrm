Subject: Urgent: Messages Not Sending to New Leads + Webhook Setup

Hi SalesApe Team,

We need urgent help with our integration:

## Issue: Messages Not Being Sent
Most of our recent leads are not receiving WhatsApp/email messages from your AI, even though they're successfully created in Airtable with all validations passing.

Working: Sandra Poon (recm2dNzUzXRSbcej)
Not Working: Tinashe Mamire (recoTX4GU2hNUkkY4), Alan Rutherford (recb3oXTX6IxFEzr5)

All have identical setup - same Base Details, validation passed, +44 phone format.

Can you please investigate why your automation isn't triggering for newer records?

## Webhook Configuration Needed
Please configure this webhook URL in our Base Details (recThsoXqOHJCdgZY):
https://edgetalentcrm-production.up.railway.app/api/salesape-webhook/update

We need real-time status updates for our CRM dashboard.

## Calendar Integration
1. Do you provide a booking link for leads?
2. What calendar system do you require (Calendly/Cal.com/Custom)?
3. What webhook payload format do you send when a booking is made?

Our Integration:
- Base: appoT1TexUksGanE8
- Table: tblTJGg187Ub84aXf
- Base Details: recThsoXqOHJCdgZY

Appreciate your quick response as clients are waiting.

Thanks,
EdgeTalent Team
